Mixed Reality room configurator

   This scene showcases my room configurator. It consists of a palm-up scrollable menu where each button spawns the selected item. The spawned objects have the "Tap to Place" component and can be manipulated to move/rotate/scale. The menu displayed can be changed between three of the available rooms (livingroom, kitchen and bedroom). Also, the menu counts with a button to toggle the "Follow me" behavior and another button that deletes all the objects spawned in the scene.	

   Try my other two scenes: "demo" displays the robot Kyle with a sci-fi gun that fires furniture while spinning around; and in "firstManipulator" the objects can be repositioned by using the MRTK object manippulator, the component "GridObjectCollection" is applied to smaller verisions of the robot Kyle and a sci-fi gun which visibility can be enabled/disabled with either the normal or the big button.	   

   Enjoy :)
